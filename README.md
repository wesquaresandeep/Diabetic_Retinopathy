Detection of the level of Diabetic Retinopathy Disease using Machine Learning Technique and creation of GUI to display the results.

Diabetic Retinopathy is the one of the major disease that occur to diabetes people, there are different levels about the stage of diabetic retinopathy, during my thesis I worked on building the machine learning model to detect the level of Diabetic Retinopath and successful detection of the Diabetic Retinopathy.

Steps and Procedure involved.

1)Download the zip folder of Diabetic Retinoapthy which I have uploaded with the main in the git and extract it, It cotains the python code, the algorithm,GUI I have also uploaded the the codes separately for reference.

2)Install python 3.10.8 go the path where python is installed, for the reference I have added my PC path for python.
C:\Users\98861\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts
open the prompt window in this loaction.

3)Open the prompt window install all the necessary packags
pip3 install opencv
pip3 install imultils
pip3 install pillow
pip3 install tensorflow

4)Once installing all the packages go the folder of Diabetic Retinopathy open the main code and run the code, make sure the images are all in the main folder once you run you will get a GUI where it will ask to select the image once the image is selected from the folder of Diabetic Retinopathy you can click on  predict button on GUI and it will predict the level of Disease.

5)For the Understanding of training and the model I have uploaded all the codes separately for the reference.
